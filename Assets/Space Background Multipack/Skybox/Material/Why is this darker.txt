This skybox will look darker than the web demo and this is because of how Unity 4.6 renders Skyboxes compared to Unity 5.

For the same results I would recommend upgrading to Unity 5 if possible (the improvements are great and the latest patches are much more production ready)

However if this isn't an option you can try tweaking the colour value of the material or saturating the base images to be brighter.

As usual any issues either head to the forums or drops us an email.

Cheers!
Jason
